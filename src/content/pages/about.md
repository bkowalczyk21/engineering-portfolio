What's up stokers?! Welcome to my page where I get to spew about myself because I understand a little bit of of JavaScript and Markdow.

 I'm Bryce Kowalczyk, a current Software Engineer at Applied Research Associates, Inc. Software Contractor at Vybe Social, LLC. and Colgate University CS/Math alumni.

 The follwing is my inspiration for what I do.

 A passionate Colgate University computer science and mathematics major with two years of software engineering experience. My technical and problem-solving skills make me an ideal software engineering candidate. I have coordinated across many facets of business, independently created applications, and taught myself new programming languages.

 Working at a small business for the last two years as a junior software engineer has given me ample exposure in collaborating with engineers and non-technical coworkers while still being a self-starter. Specifically, I was tasked with creating a mobile application to accompany the latest line of products. I taught myself Swift and the necessary iOS libraries, frameworks and architectures to deliver all of the specified functionalities. At the same time, I worked closely with the embedded systems engineer to nail down our utilization of the Bluetooth standard to deliver information and firmware updates between mobile devices and the product. The project also involved relaying timing, needed resources, and technical decisions to the company founder.
