 **Welcome fellow software, mathematics and engineering enthusiasts!**

 > I'm Bryce Kowalczyk, a current Software Engineer at Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA). My side hustle is Software Contracting at Vybe Social, LLC. I'm a Colgate University graduate where I studied Computer Science and Mathematics. 
 
 These days, I find myself in the world of robotics (C++, ROS, Linux, and CAN), but given my passion for iOS development I make sure to keep my Swift and Xcode skills sharp and up to date. Working at ARA also demands the occasional Qt, Xamarin, Visual Studio, embedded microcontroller project... you name it!

### Successes

1. Developing a Bluetooth iOS app from the ground up.

2. Debugging a complicated robotic system on the road in a high pressure environment with government PMs present.

3. Developing working code for a teleoperated CAT299D3 without the hardware present.

4. Becoming Linux CLI proficient.

5. Having an outgoing personality that resulted in being chosen as a first-year presenter at ARA's Enhanced Leadership Conference.

6. Graduating Cum Laude in one of the hardest majors at a renown university.

7. Graduating valedictorian from high school.

### Background

 My passions for technology and the "hard" sciences have taken me down a path from mobile application development, to debugging firmware assembly code, to replacing linear actuators in USG restricted areas, and everything in between. I have had the pleasure of working with sales teams, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, product managers, and government officials. Some projects have involved learning brand new languages, debugging complex systems in time sensitive environments, and teaching new team members the ropes of our code bases. 

 My ideal work environments are:

``` 
 I have been employed at Applied Research Associates, Inc. for over a year. To name a few of my responsibilities I have worked on UIs for teleoperating robots in Qt C++, developed code for the unmanned machines in modern C++ within a NixOS environment, enhanced Xamarin apps for collecting cone penetrometer data in C#. I've worked closely with electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and floor technicians to get robots up and running.
 
 Prior to ARA, I worked at a small business as a junior software engineer. Specifically, I was tasked with creating a mobile application to accompany the latest line of products. I taught myself Swift and the necessary iOS libraries, frameworks and architectures to deliver all of the specified functionalities.

### Other Passions

When I'm not coding you can find me skiing, drumming, or golfing (depending on the season).
