 Welcome fellow software, mathematics and engineering enthusiastists!

 I'm Bryce Kowalczyk, a current Software Engineer at Applied Research Associates, Inc., Software Contractor at Vybe Social, LLC, and Colgate University CS/Mathematics alumni.

 My passion for technlogy and the "hard" sciences have taken me down a paths from mobile application development to debugging firmware assembly code to replacing linear actuators in USG restricted areas and everything in between. I have had the pleasure of working with sales teams, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, product managers, and even government officials. Some projects have involved learning brand new languages, debugging complex systems in high pressure envrionments and teaching new team members the ropes of our code bases. 

 These days the languages I use the most are Swift, C++, Java and C# but I occasionally get to dabble with Python still. Beyond that, I have been doused with Linux CLI, NixOS, Xamarin.iOS, ROS, XCode, Qt, Docker, AWS, CI/CD, CAN and Ubuntu. 

 The follwing is my inspiration for what I do.

 A passionate Colgate University computer science and mathematics major with two years of software engineering experience. My technical and problem-solving skills make me an ideal software engineering candidate. I have coordinated across many facets of business, independently created applications, and taught myself new programming languages.

 Working at a small business for the last two years as a junior software engineer has given me ample exposure in collaborating with engineers and non-technical coworkers while still being a self-starter. Specifically, I was tasked with creating a mobile application to accompany the latest line of products. I taught myself Swift and the necessary iOS libraries, frameworks and architectures to deliver all of the specified functionalities. At the same time, I worked closely with the embedded systems engineer to nail down our utilization of the Bluetooth standard to deliver information and firmware updates between mobile devices and the product. The project also involved relaying timing, needed resources, and technical decisions to the company founder.
