## What Seprates Vybe

Every mainstream social media platoform comes out with a tailored feed based on what they think is best for you. I will give credit to their almagamations of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithnms, but their uninhibited usage of a user's every move can become **intrusive!** Furthermore, these algotithms pigeonhole content, leading users to a belive they are a type of person they do not want to be. 

Vybe turns the tables, letting user's _control their media feed_ and disperse content to populations excited about that category of media. 

Some exciting features:
 - Pick and choose the type of posts you would like to see
 - Social media and news feeds all in one platform
 - Media categories updated regurarly
 - Zero malicious data collection

Upcoming responsibilities include:
1. Developing the News Feed
2. Migrating and updating the backend
3. Adding a Delete User feature 
4. Implementing comment threads on posts with the option to tag others.
