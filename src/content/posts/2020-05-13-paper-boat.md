## What seprates Vybe

Every mainstream social media platoform comes out with a tailored feed feed based on what they think is best for you. Granted their stae-of-of-the-art machine learning algirithnm almagamtions must be given some creit, their uninhibited usage of a user's every move can become intrusive. Furthermore, these algotithms can pigeionhole one into a type of eperosn who they dp not want to be but tend to click on related media. Thta's why at Vyve we belive in the user's right to filter their feed and post content to populations where they want to be heard.
