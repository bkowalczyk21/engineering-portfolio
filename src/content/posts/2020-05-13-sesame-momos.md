### Eyes on the stars
As youngster I always had my eyes on the skies. That's where all the big questions are; Why are we here? Whats before/outside the universe? Why make all this space with us poor matter so far apart? 

### Applying transformations to light curves
Hence, as a budding high school senior I reached out to the Telescope Specialist at Middlebury college and he set me to work confirming the eclipe period of the binary star system UX Urae Majoris. I used curve-folding and tranformaion software on light curves to come up with the most accurate ecplise periods of the rapidly rotating star system. 

Binary star systems such as UX UMa are rare since their orbital plane lies in our line of sight giving us a a unique opportunity to study them. In the end my finding further backed up current theories on the nature of of the UX UMa star system.
